I am still incompetent when it comes to many things regarding pointers, classes, objects, structures, etc.
I am glad that the directions specify whether each function is a constructor, accessor, destructor, etc.
They also specify whether the parameters/arguments are pointers or not, which is very helpful for me.
I still don't really understand the practical application of pointers. I know they carry the memory address
but I still dont understand exactly why we use them. Just generally knowing the syntax to access the data i
want to has been very difficult. I had a very hard time getting option 4, remove a video game, to work. I was
pretty confident with function definitions and pointers because of the directions. Knowing what to do in the
.cpp files was very difficult though. This was very good practice in understanding array positioning and how
well structures, objects, and arrays can work together to manage data.
